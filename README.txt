Reference 1 was consulted to look up the correct calling method of various syscalls. 
Reference 2 and 3 was used to see the usage of struct stat, struct dirent and DIR *dp and their corresponding funtions.
Reference 4 was used to see the usage of the pipe() system call along with fork() and execvp().
Referece 5 was used as a preliminary guideline to implement multi piping and forking functionality. Actuall implementation varies widely from the cited method.
